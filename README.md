## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!
It was pretty easy to find the mistakes after the first 3. Its good to read through the code andd make sense of it before going straigt to finding the error. Made the last two very easy
First two times I built the app again after the fix but forgoto to re run and got a bit fustrated. So good to know to make sure to build AND run
